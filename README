## Intro

rest-js is a wrapper around node-mongodb-native for easier use of MongoDB from nodejs.

This version needs: 
  - node-mongodb-native, http://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/ (at the exact version V0.7.1 - V0.7.2 to V0.7.4 are not working)
  - mongodb, http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads (1.4.2 - The 1.5 serie doesn't seem to work fine yet...)
  - nodetk, http://github.com/AF83/nodetk (after commit 8adb54316439e5f14853)
